# Tumor-Prediction-FCIS
A predictive modeling project that was built using python, the input for the project was 30 numerical features and one label(whether has a tumor or not), the project had 7 algorithms implemented each one trains on the data to give a prediction on the test data(unknown to the model), the average accuracy was 98% and the highest accuracy was a decision tree model with 100% accuracy.
